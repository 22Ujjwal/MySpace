## Daily Tracks
🔹 I choose to post a small portions of learning here so that my commits maintains my learning trails. 

🔹  Learning is cool and whats even cooler is to build effienct fullstack project.

**Life is fun.** 

I read about [ANNs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/artificial-neural-networks-and-its-applications/), CNNs and [RNNs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-recurrent-neural-network/) would suggest referencing them in future. Neural Nets are my new friends!! I am also reading IKIGAI, Does seem like my website needs a commit today, so journaling here. Working on it!

**Happy Coding<>**
